# TinyMCE Table Calculator Plugin

Table Calculator, Spreadsheet like, plugin for TinyMCE. The plugin stores the math calculation as a class name in the cell tag and inserts the result as the cell value. It only works inside tables. Operations like + - * / ( ) and symbols like " $ . are allowed. This plugin does NOT allow you make references between cells. Position the TinyMCE cursor in a cell, and press the plugin icon to insert/edit the math calculation of that cell.
